             In the Visayas Islands, particularly in Leyte, coconut wine is referred to as tuba. After it has been fermented and distilled for a few months, it is called bahal. If it's distilled for a year or more, it becomes bahalina. It is a more accessible alcoholic drink that the local people enjoy. This doesn't mean that bahalina is poor quality, however. For me, it is a high-quality, organic alcoholic drink that has no added chemicals—just barok (the reddish bark of the mangrove tree).</b></p>
          <p class="dark"><b>How to Make Tuba or Coconut Red wine?</b><br>Tuba, also referred to as coconut wine in English, is made from coconut sap. In the provinces, this is typically done using the most basic tools: a knife (called a sanggot) and natural agility—and involves climbing the coconut trees in order to make a cut in the plant's inflorescence. The sap is subsequently collected by the climber by tying a container to the tree; this process can occasionally take place overnight.</p>
